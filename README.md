# Structural-Health-Monitoring
Structural Health Monitoring GUI
This project is a Python-based GUI application for Structural Health Monitoring using machine learning. It allows users to load structural data from a CSV file, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
Features
Load structural health data (CSV format)
Automatically compute engineered features
Train a Random Forest model to detect anomalies
Evaluate model performance with a classification report and confusion matrix
GUI built with tkinter for ease of use
Requirements
Install dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
Usage
1. Run the script:
python structural_health_monitor_gui.py
2. In the GUI:
Click Load CSV Data to select and preview a dataset.
Click Train Model to train a Random Forest model.
Click Evaluate Model to display model metrics and a confusion matrix.
Input Data Format
Your CSV file should contain the following columns:
Vibration
Stress
Temperature
Label (Target column with class labels, e.g., Normal or Anomaly)
Feature Engineering
The application automatically generates these additional features:
Vib_Stress_Ratio = Vibration / Stress
Temp_Stress_Product = Temperature * Stress
Vib_Temp_Sum = Vibration + Temperature
Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Scaler: StandardScaler
Trained model and scaler are saved as rf_gui_model.pkl and scaler_gui.pkl.
Output
Console-like text output in the GUI for data preview, training accuracy, and evaluation report
Matplotlib plot of confusion matrix
